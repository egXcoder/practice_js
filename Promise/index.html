    Promises has nothing to do with threading, its just a mechanism to organize the async task
    with chain of handlers. and it favourite non-blocking, what i mean by that: 
    - Promise at first will try to achieve its task procedurly
    - If promise find itself awaiting IO operation like fetch from file or fetch from internet or even awaiting
        another promise, its going to initialize this line and will tell the main context that it promise to get 
        to this part later, and main continue will continue its work.
    - After main context finish all its work, main will get back to the promise it made and continue with its operations
    after the await keyword if anything left there then it will call the promise handlers.
     

    Promise is just a wrapper around calculating value through sequence of callbacks,
    its not really creating new thread on its own because its using the main thread
