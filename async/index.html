        <pre>
    Async Keyword has two properties
    1. you can't depend on it to return concrete value, it will always return promise
    2. it allows inside it the await keyword, which can be used to force the function to finish the promise first
        and also it gets concrete value from promise
        </pre>
    </code>
    <p>To Practice any of the functions .. rename function name to runTest and click on the button</p>
    <button onclick="runTest()">Click Me To Test</button>
    <p id="output">Output</p>

    <script>        
        //canIDependOnAsyncFunctionToReturnConcreteValue
        function runTest(){
            let a = returnTestValue(); //a=promise fullfilled
            console.log(a*2); //NAN
        }

        async function returnTestValue(){
            return 2;
        }



        //checkBenefitOfAwaitKeyword
        function checkBenefitOfAwaitKeyword() {
            console.log('calling');
            //the main benefit of async keyword is that it allows await keyword..
            //await is going to force the hook function to wait untill promise is fullfilled,
            //and only after then hook is going to continue execution
            //but yet that doesn't block hook2 from being executed as well as the final console.log
            //and after js finish it work it will go back to the a promise and to the hook and will continue hook execution 
            
            let a = hook(); // a=pending promise
            hook2();
            console.log("runTest Finished His work");
        }

        async function hook(){
            await Promise.resolve(() => { return 2; }); //hook function will pause here and it will allow the main context to continue
            console.log("hook called"); //this will continue after the main context has finished its work,
            // and now browser can spare some time to finish this part
        }

        function hook2(){
            console.log("hook2 called");
        }




        

        //another behavior of async keyword that it return a promise not a concrete value
        function AsyncFunctionReturnPromise() {
            console.log(asyncFunction()); // Promise

            asyncFunction().then((value)=>{
                //this handler is called after javascript finish its work totally with the screen
                console.log(value+1);
                return value+1;
            })
        }

        async function asyncFunction(){
            //async function automatically return a promise which can be used to chain with other handler
            //async keyword has no effect on the flow, this block is going to be called normally as a procedure call
            console.log('calling');
            return 1;
