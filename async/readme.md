Async function provide us with a clean and concise syntax that enables us to write less code to accomplish the same outcome we would get with promises. Async is nothing more than syntactic sugar for promises.

Async functions are created by prepending the word async before the function declaration like this:

    const asyncFunction = async () => {
    // Code
    }
